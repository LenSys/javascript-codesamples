        Find Players With Zero or One Losses

        You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] i
        ndicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.

        Return a list answer of size 2 where:

        answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
        answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
        The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

        Note:

        You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
        The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.
        
        Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
        Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
        Explanation:
                     Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
                     Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
                     Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
                     Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].

        Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
        Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
        Explanation:
                     Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
                     Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
                     Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
