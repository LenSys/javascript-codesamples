        Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences

        A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single 
        space with no leading or trailing spaces.

        You are given an array of strings sentences, where each 
        sentences[i] represents a single sentence.

        Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

        Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
        Output: 6
        Explanation: 
                     - The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", 
                       has 5 words in total.
                     - The second sentence, "i think so too", 
                       has 4 words in total.
                     - The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", 
                       has 6 words in total.
                     
                     Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence 
                     comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.
