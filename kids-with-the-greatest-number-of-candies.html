        Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

        There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, 
        where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, 
        and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that 
        you have.

        Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, 
        after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the 
        greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

        Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

        Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
        Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
        Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
                     - Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the 
                       greatest among the kids.
                     - Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the 
                       greatest among the kids.
                     - Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the 
                       greatest among the kids.
                     - Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not 
                       the greatest among the kids.
                     - Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is 
                       the greatest among the kids.

        Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
        Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
        Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
                        Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, 
                        even if a different kid is given the extra candy.

        Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
        Output: [true,false,true]
