        Sort Characters By Frequency

        Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the 
        characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in 
        the string.

        Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
        
        Input: s = "tree"
        Output: "eert"
        Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
                     So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is 
                     also a valid answer.

        Input: s = "cccaaa"
        Output: "aaaccc"
        Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" 
                     are valid answers. Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same 
                     characters must be together.

        Input: s = "Aabb"
        Output: "bbAa"
        Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
                     Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
