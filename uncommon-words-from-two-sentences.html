        Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

        A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

        A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not 
        appear in the other sentence.

        Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return 
        the answer in any order.

        Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
        Output: ["sweet","sour"]

        Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
        Output: ["banana"]
