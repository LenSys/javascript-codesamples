        Check if Numbers Are Ascending in a Sentence
        
        A sentence is a list of tokens separated by a single space with no l
        eading or trailing spaces. Every token is either a positive number 
        consisting of digits 0-9 with no leading zeros, or a word consisting of 
        lowercase English letters.

        For example, "a puppy has 2 eyes 4 legs" is a sentence with seven tokens: 
        "2" and "4" are numbers and the other tokens such as "puppy" are words.
        Given a string s representing a sentence, you need to check if all the 
        numbers in s are strictly increasing from left to right (i.e., other than 
        the last number, each number is strictly smaller than the number on its 
        right in s).

        Return true if so, or false otherwise.
        
        Input: s = "1 box has 3 blue 4 red 6 green and 12 yellow marbles"
        Output: true
        Explanation: The numbers in s are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 12.
                     They are strictly increasing from left to right: 
                     1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 12.

        Input: s = "hello world 5 x 5"
        Output: false
        Explanation: The numbers in s are: 5, 5. They are not strictly increasing.

        Input: s = "sunset is at 7 51 pm overnight lows will be in the low 50 and 60 s"
        Output: false
        Explanation: The numbers in s are: 7, 51, 50, 60. 
                     They are not strictly increasing.

        var areNumbersAscending = function(s) {
    
            let arr = s.split(' ');

            let isAscending = true;
            
            for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                // get current word, try to convert to number
                let num = parseInt(arr[i]);
                
                // check if converted word is a number
                if(!Number.isNaN(num)) {
                    console.log(num);
