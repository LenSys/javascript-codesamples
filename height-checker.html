        Height Checker

        A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are 
        asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this 
        ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the 
        expected height of the ith student in line.

        You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the 
        students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in 
        line (0-indexed).

        Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

        Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
        Output: 3
        Explanation: 
                     heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
                     expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
                     Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.

        Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
        Output: 5
        Explanation:
                     heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
                     expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
                     All indices do not match.

        Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
        Output: 0
        Explanation:
                     heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
                     expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
                     All indices match.
