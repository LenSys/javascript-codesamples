        Cells in a Range on an Excel Sheet

        A cell (r, c) of an excel sheet is represented as a string "<col><row>" 
        where:

        <col> denotes the column number c of the cell. It is represented by 
        alphabetical letters.
        For example, the 1st column is denoted by 'A', the 2nd by 'B', the 3rd 
        by 'C', and so on.
        <row> is the row number r of the cell. The rth row is represented by the 
        integer r.
        You are given a string s in the format "<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>", 
        where <col1> represents the column c1, <row1> represents the row r1, 
        <col2> represents the column c2, and <row2> represents the row r2, 
        such that r1 <= r2 and c1 <= c2.

        Return the list of cells (x, y) such that r1 <= x <= r2 and c1 <= y <= c2. 
        The cells should be represented as strings in the format mentioned above 
        and be sorted in non-decreasing order first by columns and then by rows.

        Input: s = "K1:L2"
        Output: ["K1","K2","L1","L2"]

        Input: s = "A1:F1"
        Output: ["A1","B1","C1","D1","E1","F1"]
        */
        var cellsInRange = function(s) {
    
            let startCol = s[0];
            let startRow = s[1];
            
            let endCol = s[3];
            let endRow = s[4];
            
            let startColCharcode = startCol.charCodeAt(0);
            let endColCharcode = endCol.charCodeAt(0);
            
            let cells = [];
            let k = 0;
            for(let i = startColCharcode; i <= endColCharcode; i++) {
                let col = String.fromCharCode(i);
                
                for(let j = startRow; j <= endRow; j++) {
                    cells[k] = col + "" + j;
                    k++;
                }
            }
            
            return cells;
        };


        // Output: ["K1","K2","L1","L2"]
        console.log(cellsInRange("K1:L2"));

        // Output: ["A1","B1","C1","D1","E1","F1"]
        console.log(cellsInRange("A1:F1"));
