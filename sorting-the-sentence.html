        Sorting the Sentence

        A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with 
        no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and 
        uppercase English letters.

        A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to 
        each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

        For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as 
        "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
        Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct 
        and return the original sentence.
        
        Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
        Output: "This is a sentence"
        Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions 
                     "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.

        Input: s = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3"
        Output: "Me Myself and I"
        Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions 
                     "Me1 Myself2 and3 I4", then remove the numbers.

        var sortSentence = function(s) {
    
            let words = s.split(' ');
            let orderedWords = [];
            let orderedSentence = '';
            
            for(let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
                let wordLength = words[i].length;
                let index = words[i][wordLength - 1];
                
                // console.log(index);
                orderedWords[index - 1] = words[i].substring(0, words[i].length - 1);
            }
            // console.log(orderedWords);
            
            orderedSentence = orderedWords.join(' ').trim();
            
            return orderedSentence;
        };

        console.log(sortSentence("is2 sentence4 This1 a3"));
