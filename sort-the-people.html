        Sort the People

        You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that 
        consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

        For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height 
        of the ith person.

        Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

        Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
        Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
        Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

        Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
        Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
        Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the 
                     second Bob.
