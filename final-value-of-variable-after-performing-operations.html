        Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

        There is a programming language with only four operations 
        and one variable X:

        ++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
        --X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
        Initially, the value of X is 0.

        Given an array of strings operations containing a list of 
        operations, return the final value of X after performing 
        all the operations.

        Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
        Output: 1
        Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
                     Initially, X = 0.
                     --X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
                     X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
                     X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.

                let operation = operations[i];
