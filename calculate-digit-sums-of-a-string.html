        Calculate Digit Sums of a String

        You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.

        A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. 
        In one round, do the following:

        Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k 
        characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the 
        second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be 
        smaller than k.
        Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its 
        digits. For example, "346" is replaced with "13" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
        Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of 
        the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.
        Return s after all rounds have been completed.

        Input: s = "11111222223", k = 3
        Output: "135"
        Explanation: 
                     - For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: 
                     "111", "112", "222", and "23".
                    ​ ​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 
                     1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
                     So, s becomes "3" + "4" + "6" + "5" = "3465" after the first 
                     round.
                     - For the second round, we divide s into "346" and "5".
                     Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 
                     5 = 5. 
                     So, s becomes "13" + "5" = "135" after second round. 
                     Now, s.length <= k, so we return "135" as the answer.
        
        Input: s = "00000000", k = 3
        Output: "000"
        Explanation: 
                     We divide s into "000", "000", and "00".
                     Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 
                     0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. 
                     s becomes "0" + "0" + "0" = "000", whose length is equal to k, 
                     so we return "000".

        var digitSum = function(s, k) {
    
            let ansStr = s;
            while(ansStr.length > k) {
                 let u = '';
                 for(let i = 0; i < ansStr.length; i+= k) {
                     let t = 0;
                     let substr = ansStr.substring(i, i + k);
         
                     // console.log("substr", substr);
                     for(let j = 0; j < substr.length; j++) {
                         t += Number(substr[j]);
                     }
                     u += t.toString();
                 }
                 ansStr = u.toString();
                 // console.log("ansStr", ansStr);
                 
            }

            return ansStr;
         };

         // Output: 135
         console.log(digitSum("11111222223", 3));

         // Output: 000
         console.log(digitSum("00000000", 3));
