        Count of Matches in Tournament

        You are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that 
        has strange rules:

            If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with 
            another team. A total of n / 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams 
            advance to the next round.
            
            If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances 
            in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 
            matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next 
            round.

        Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is 
        decided.

        Input: n = 7
        Output: 6
        Explanation: Details of the tournament: 
                     - 1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
                     - 2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
                     - 3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is 
                       declared the winner.
                     Total number of matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.

        Input: n = 14
        Output: 13
        Explanation: Details of the tournament:
                     - 1st Round: Teams = 14, Matches = 7, and 7 teams advance.
                     - 2nd Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
                     - 3rd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
                     - 4th Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is 
                       declared the winner.
                     Total number of matches = 7 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.
