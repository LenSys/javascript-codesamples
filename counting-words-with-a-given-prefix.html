        Counting Words With a Given Prefix

        You are given an array of strings words and a string pref.

        Return the number of strings in words that contain pref as a prefix.
        A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

        Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: 
                     "attention" and "attend".

        Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
        Output: 0
        Explanation: There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.

        var prefixCount = function(words, pref) {
    
            let prefCount = 0;
            for(let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
                let word = words[i];
                let wordPref = word.substring(0, pref.length);
                
                if(pref === wordPref) {
                    prefCount++;

            }
            
            return prefCount;

        // Output: 2
        console.log(prefixCount(["pay","attention","practice","attend"], "at"));

        // Output: 0
        console.log(prefixCount(["leetcode","win","loops","success"], "code"));
