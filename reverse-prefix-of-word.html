        Reverse Prefix of Word
        
        Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that 
        starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). 
        If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

        For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment 
        that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
        Return the resulting string.
        
        Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
        Output: "dcbaefd"
        Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
                     Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string 
                     is "dcbaefd".

        Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
        Output: "zxyxxe"
        Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
                     Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string 
                     is "zxyxxe".

        Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
        Output: "abcd"
        Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
                     You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
