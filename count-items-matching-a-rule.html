        Count Items Matching a Rule

        You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] 
        describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a 
        rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

        The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

        ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
        ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
        ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
        Return the number of items that match the given rule.

        Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],
                        ["phone","gold","iphone"]], 
                        ruleKey = "color", 
                        ruleValue = "silver"
        Output: 1
        Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, 
                     which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

        Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],
                        ["phone","gold","iphone"]], 
                        ruleKey = "type", 
                        ruleValue = "phone"
        Output: 2
        Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, 
                     which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and 
                     ["phone","gold","iphone"]. 
                     Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not 
                     match.
