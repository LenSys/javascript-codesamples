        Number of 1 Bits

        Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the 
        number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

        Note:
              Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned 
              integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed 
              integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the 
              integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it 
              is signed or unsigned.
              In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's 
              complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input 
              represents the signed integer. -3.

        Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The input binary string 
                     00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three 
                     '1' bits.

        Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
        Output: 1
        Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 
                     has a total of one '1' bit.

        Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
        Output: 31
        Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 
                     has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
