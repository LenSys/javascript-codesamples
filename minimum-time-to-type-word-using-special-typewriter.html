        Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter

        There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters 'a' to 'z' 
        arranged in a circle with a pointer. A character can only be typed if the pointer 
        is pointing to that character. The pointer is initially pointing to the character 'a'.
        (see https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-type-word-using-special-typewriter/)

        Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:

        Move the pointer one character counterclockwise or clockwise.
        Type the character the pointer is currently on.
        Given a string word, return the minimum number of seconds to type out the characters 
        in word.

        Input: word = "abc"
        Output: 5
        Explanation: 
                     The characters are printed as follows:
                     - Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the pointer is initially on 'a'.
                     - Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
                     - Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
                     - Move the pointer clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.
                     - Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
        
        Input: word = "bza"
        Output: 7
        Explanation:
                     The characters are printed as follows:
                     - Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
                     - Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
                     - Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 2 seconds.
                     - Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
                     - Move the pointer clockwise to 'a' in 1 second.
                     - Type the character 'a' in 1 second.
        
        Input: word = "zjpc"
        Output: 34
        Explanation:
                     The characters are printed as follows:
                     - Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 1 second.
                     - Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
                     - Move the pointer clockwise to 'j' in 10 seconds.
                     - Type the character 'j' in 1 second.
                     - Move the pointer clockwise to 'p' in 6 seconds.
                     - Type the character 'p' in 1 second.
                     - Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'c' in 13 seconds.
                     - Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
