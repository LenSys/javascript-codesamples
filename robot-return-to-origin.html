        Robot Return to Origin

        There is a robot starting at the position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. 
        Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it 
        completes its moves.

        You are given a string moves that represents the move sequence of the robot 
        where moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are 'R' (right), 'L' (left), 
        'U' (up), and 'D' (down).

        Return true if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its 
        moves, or false otherwise.

        Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. 'R' will always make 
        the robot move to the right once, 'L' will always make it move left, etc. 
        Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each 
        move.

        Input: moves = "UD"
        Output: true
        Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the 
        same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we 
        return true.

        Input: moves = "LL"
        Output: false
        Explanation: The robot moves left twice. It ends up two "moves" to the left of 
        the origin. We return false because it is not at the origin at the end of its 
        moves.
