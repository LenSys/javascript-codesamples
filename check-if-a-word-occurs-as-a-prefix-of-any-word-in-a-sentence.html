        Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence

        Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and 
        a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

        Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix 
        of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of 
        the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

        A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

        Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
        Output: 4
        Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.

        Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
        Output: 2
        Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in 
                     the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.

        Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
        Output: -1
        Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.

        var isPrefixOfWord = function(sentence, searchWord) {
            let words = sentence.split(' ');
            
            let prefixIndex = -1;
            for(let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
                let word = words[i];
                
                if(word.substring(0, searchWord.length) == searchWord) {
                    prefixIndex = i + 1;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            return prefixIndex;
        };

        // Output: 4
        console.log(isPrefixOfWord("i love eating burger", "burg"));

        // Output: 2
        console.log(isPrefixOfWord("this problem is an easy problem", "pro"));

        // Output: -1
        console.log(isPrefixOfWord("He is tired", "you"));
