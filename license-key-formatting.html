        License Key Formatting

        You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only 
        alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups 
        by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.

        We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k 
        characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but 
        still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash 
        inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to 
        uppercase.

        Return the reformatted license key.

        Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
        Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
        Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 
                     characters.
                     Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

        Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
        Output: "2-5G-3J"
        Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 
                     characters except the first part as it could be shorter as 
                     mentioned above.

        var licenseKeyFormatting = function(s, k) {
            const keySequence = s.replaceAll('-', '');
            
            let licenseKey = '';
            
            for(let i = keySequence.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                licenseKey = keySequence[i].toUpperCase() + licenseKey;
                
                if((((keySequence.length - i) % k) === 0) && (i > 0)) {
                    licenseKey = '-' + licenseKey;
                }
            }
            
            return licenseKey;
        };

        console.log(licenseKeyFormatting("5F3Z-2e-9-w", 4));

        // Output: "2-5G-3J"
        console.log(licenseKeyFormatting("2-5g-3-J", 2));
