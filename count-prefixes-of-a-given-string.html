        Count Prefixes of a Given String

        You are given a string array words and a string s, where words[i] and s comprise 
        only of lowercase English letters.

        Return the number of strings in words that are a prefix of s.
        A prefix of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string. 
        A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

        Input: words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], s = "abc"
        Output: 3
        Explanation:
                     The strings in words which are a prefix of s = "abc" are:
                     "a", "ab", and "abc".
                     Thus the number of strings in words which are a prefix of s is 3.

        Input: words = ["a","a"], s = "aa"
        Output: 2
        Explanation:
                     Both of the strings are a prefix of s. 
                     Note that the same string can occur multiple times in words, and it 
                     should be counted each time.

        var countPrefixes = function(words, s) {
    
            let prefixCount = 0;
            for(let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
                let word = words[i];
                
                if(s.substring(0, word.length) === word) {
                    prefixCount++;
                }
            }
            
            return prefixCount;
        };

        // Output: 3
        console.log(countPrefixes(["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], "abc"));

        // Output: 2
        console.log(countPrefixes(["a","a"], "aa"));
