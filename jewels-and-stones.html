        Jewels and Stones

        You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that 
        are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. 
        Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. 
        You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

        Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type 
        of stone from "A".

        Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
        Output: 3

        Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
        Output: 0
